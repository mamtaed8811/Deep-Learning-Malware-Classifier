# Deep-Learning-Malware-Classifier
This Project implemented two scalable approaches using the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) ML algorithm (3 different architectures) and the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) ML algorithm to classify a malware to its corresponding family. The first approach makes use of CNNs to learn a feature hierarchy to discriminate among samples of malware represented as gray-scale images. The second approach uses the KNN architecture introduced by L. Nataraj in his paper: Malware Visualization to visualize and automatically classify malware samples. The implemented methods achieved an improvement of (96.98%, 97.54% and 96%), and 96.98% with respect to the training accuracy and loss. The best model was able to achieve almost 99% prediction accuracy and was very fast during training and prediction as well.

The codes folder has all the python codes to train the models and because the size of the saved ConvNets were exceeding the file size limit here, I couldn't upload the saved models here after training.
